# Avian frugivory and tree regeneration in the Atlantic rainforest (SE Brazil).

This are datasets and analyses accompanying the papers:
- Rother, D.C., Jordano, P., Rodrigues, R.R. & Pizo, M.A. (2013) Demographic bottlenecks in tropical plant regeneration: A comparative analysis of causal influences. Perspectives in Plant Ecology Evolution and Systematics, 15, 86–96.

- Rother, D.C., Pizo, M.A., Siqueira, T., Rodrigues, R.R. & Jordano, P. (2015b) Community-wide spatial and temporal discordances of seed-seedling shadows in a tropical rainforest (ed P Adam). PLoS ONE, 10, e0123346–12.

They consist in:
- Seed trap and seedling plots data, together with field germination and seed predation experiments.
- Direct watches at fruiting trees with observations on frugivore activity and feeding behavior.
- Spatial patter data for seed rain and seedling recruitment.
